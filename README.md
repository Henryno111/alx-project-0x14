## API Overview
The MoviesDatabase API provides a rich set of features for accessing movie data. It allows developers to retrieve detailed information about movies, actors, and genres, as well as perform searches and access ratings.

## Version
Current API Version: v1.0

## Available Endpoints
- **GET /movies**: Retrieve a list of movies.
- **GET /movies/{id}**: Get detailed information about a specific movie.
- **GET /actors**: Retrieve a list of actors.
- **GET /actors/{id}**: Get detailed information about a specific actor.
- **GET /genres**: List all available genres.

## Request and Response Format
### Example Request
```http
GET /movies HTTP/1.1
Host: api.moviesdatabase.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Response
```json
{
  "movies": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "Inception",
      "release_year": 2010,
      "genre": "Sci-Fi"
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "title": "The Matrix",
      "release_year": 1999,
      "genre": "Action"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Authentication
To authenticate your requests, you must include an API key in the headers:
- Header: `Authorization`
- Format: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`

## Error Handling
Common error responses include:
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid or missing API key.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource does not exist.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred on the server side.

To handle errors, check the HTTP status code and log the response message for debugging.

## Usage Limits and Best Practices
- **Rate Limits**: The API allows up to 100 requests per minute. Exceeding this limit will result in a 429 Too Many Requests error.
- **Caching**: Cache frequent requests to reduce the number of API calls.
- **Pagination**: Use pagination for endpoints returning large datasets to optimize performance.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage and retry failed requests.
